I applied to the 2021 National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) in the field of Materials Science. Although I did not win the fellowship, my application received positive reviews (4 “Excellent” and 2 “Very Good” ratings). I’m documenting my application process here in the hopes that it may be useful to future applicants.

## Overview of the NSF GRFP

The **NSF GRFP** is an excellent way to kickstart a research career in STEM. Here are some of the key points about the program:

- **Funding:** Provides \$37,000 per year to the student for three years, plus additional funds to your department.
- **Flexibility:** You may defer the fellowship for up to two years (if you have other funding), although you cannot defer solely to take a year off.
- **Eligibility:**
  1. Must be a U.S. Citizen, U.S. National, or permanent resident.
  2. Must be a graduating senior or a first/second year graduate student (graduate students can apply only once).
  3. Intended for those pursuing science research (not applicable to medical school).
  
For the most current eligibility details and deadlines (typically the last week of October), please refer to the official [NSF GRFP website](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) and the detailed NSF presentation on the program’s requirements.

## The Application Process

The application consists of several key components:

1. **Essays:**  
   - **Personal Statement, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement** (up to 3 pages).  
     *This essay tells your story—how you got here and where you’re headed, including any unique personal or professional experiences that add to your diversity in STEM.*
   - **Graduate Research Plan Statement** (up to 2 pages).  
     *This is a research proposal outlining an original project idea, your approach, and the potential scientific and societal impacts of your work.*

2. **Letters of Recommendation:**  
   - At least three letters are required. It is beneficial to have a mix of references who can address both your intellectual merit and broader impacts.

**Review Criteria:**  
Your essays are evaluated on two main criteria:  
- **Intellectual Merit:** Your potential to advance knowledge within your field.  
- **Broader Impacts:** How your work will benefit society and contribute to desired societal outcomes.

Each essay should include clear, explicit headers for *Intellectual Merit* and *Broader Impacts*.

## Tips and Resources for a Successful Application

Below are some suggestions—many of which come from my own experience and from resources shared by previous NSF GRFP winners:

### Before You Begin
- **Read the Official Guidelines:**  
  Thoroughly review the NSF GRFP Program Solicitation. Missing formatting guidelines can lead to desk-rejection.
- **Understand the Review Process:**  
  Familiarize yourself with the review criteria. Both essays must explicitly address Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.

### Getting Started
- **Essay Structure Suggestions:**

  **For the Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement:**  
  - **Personal Background:** (≈1 page) Share your journey into science and any personal challenges you overcame.
  - **Relevant Background:** (≈1 page) Detail your research experience, publications, presentations, and awards.
  - **Future Goals:** (≈½ page) Describe your vision for graduate school and beyond.
  - **Explicit Sections for Review Criteria:**  
    - **Intellectual Merit:** Summarize your scientific contributions.
    - **Broader Impacts:** Describe how your experiences and research have or will benefit society.

  **For the Graduate Research Plan Statement:**  
  - **Introduction:** Outline the scientific problem and its importance.
  - **Research Plan:** Describe your approach, creative strategies, and contingency plans.
  - **Intellectual Merit:** Explain how your project will advance knowledge.
  - **Broader Impacts:** Detail potential societal benefits and outreach plans.
  - **Conclusion:** Optionally summarize the overall impact of your project.

### Practical Advice
- **Start Early and Seek Feedback:**  
  Ask for letters of recommendation early, and have your drafts reviewed by past fellowship winners or experienced professors.
- **Write for a General Science Audience:**  
  Assume the reviewer is knowledgeable in your primary field but not necessarily your specific subfield.
- **Use Visuals and Formatting:**  
  Don’t hesitate to include figures and bold key points (results, awards, contributions) to capture the reviewer’s attention.
- **Overcome Imposter Syndrome:**  
  Believe in your scientific value. Emphasize your achievements and unique perspective confidently.

## My Personal Experience

In my application, I structured my essays into clear sections as described above. In the **Personal, Relevant Background, and Future Goals Statement**, I highlighted:
- How I got into computational research in Materials Science.
- Detailed descriptions of my research projects and the intellectual contributions of each.
- My outreach and teaching experiences that demonstrate broader impacts.

For the **Graduate Research Plan Statement**, I focused on:
- Outlining a compelling research proposal.
- Emphasizing the novelty and transformative potential of my approach.
- Explicitly addressing both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts in separate, clearly labeled sections.

These strategies, along with rigorous feedback and revising, contributed to the positive reviews I received—even though the final outcome wasn’t the fellowship.

## Final Thoughts

The NSF GRFP is more than just funding—it’s a validation of your potential as a future research leader. Here are a few final pieces of advice:
- **Don’t Sell Yourself Short:** Emphasize your achievements and potential.
- **Be Specific:** Clearly detail how your work meets the two main review criteria.
- **Get Help:** Use your department’s resources and ask for feedback from experienced mentors.
- **Stay Updated:** This advice was last updated in September 2021; always check the latest guidelines and requirements from NSF.

Good luck to all future applicants! Feel free to reach out with any questions or to share your own experiences.
